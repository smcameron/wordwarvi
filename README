To build on linux, FreeBSD, or Mac OSX, just type "make"

  You'll need portaudio (v 19, not 18)
  (portaudio-devel rpm packages)
  and libvorbisfile (libvorbis-devel rpm package) to decode the 
  included ogg files for sound to work.
  
  See: http://www.portaudio.com/
  
  To build without any sound support, type "make WITHAUDIO=no" 
  
To build on windows:

  1. Download install mingw
  2. Download codeblocks ide (nightly build recommended)
  3. Download/clone wordwarvi source
  4. Create win32 folder in wordwarvi source directory.
  5. Download precompiled gtk (all-in-one bundle) libs,
     copy include and bin folders into wordwarvi/win32
  6. Download precompiled vorbis/ogg libs, copy include
     content into wordwarvi/win32/include and the dlls into
     wordwarvi/win32/bin.
  7. Download precompiled portaudio lib, copy include content into
     wordwarvi/win32/include and the dlls into wordwarvi/win32/bin.
  8. Open wordwarvi.cbp in codeblocks and build.
