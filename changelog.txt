Changelog for wordwarvi:

Sun Jun 29 07:48:40 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Lose dependency of ogg_to_pcm.o on fake target HAS_VORBISFILE as
  this caused "make install" to rebuild it, which is a no-go for
  certain things (e.g. Fedora live-cd environment).   Thanks to
  Hans de Goede for this correction.
* Added a DESTDIR variable into the makefile to make packaging for
  CRUX linux easier.  Thanks to Danny Rawlins for this patch.
* Add changelog.txt and file describing how to make new levels
  into the tarball.
* Add some sanity checks of the VERSION string and version.h file
  to help prevent me from screwing up the version numbers in released
  tarballs.
* Added little guys with jetpacks who shoot lasers at you.
* Fixed bug that when you got killed and consequently drop the guys you'd been
  carrying, the guys thought you just picked them up, and consequently shouted
  in unison, "woohoo!", even though you just got killed, which was kind of cruel
  of them.
* When you get killed, the comments in the code say you get a 30 sec
  breather (which is incredibly long.)   Actually, you got a 30 frame
  breather -- a one second breather -- which was a bit too short.  Fixed
  the code to give you a 4 second breather, which seems about right.
* Improved the appearance of the jetpack guys.
* Fixed a problem with the drawing of the jet pilots.
* Now the jet pilots eject a lot faster, and so survive
  the ejection (don't get immediately shot) more frequently.
* Changed how sparks are drawn a bit to make exhaust of jetpacks
  look better.
* Changed how jetpack guys move to make them less robotic.
* Reduce ejection speed of jetpilots so that you can kind of see
  them and they don't seem to just come out of nowhere.
* updated version.h to 0.17

Sun Jun 22 09:23:32 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.15 and 0.16

* Added a confirmation screen when quitting, so you don't accidentally
  quit a game by a single keystroke/button press..
* Add apostrophe glyph
* Added asterisk glyph.
* Fixed bug that selecting 'Don't Quit' with the joystick tended to
  also put a quarter in.
* Make joystick selection of quit screen buttons use only the laser button.
  This is so that if a joystick button is mapped to quit, the button will
  not also select 'Don't Quit' almost immediately, making the quit screen
  rapidly appear and disappear.
* Now, if a joystick quit button is mapped, pressing it
  while in attract mode doesn't put in a quarter instead.
* Made quit screen work in high score screen, and also during
  between-level intermissions.
* Updated blimp messages to include the stuff you put at the front
  of GPL'ed source files.
* Fixed bug that negative scores would get counted as high scores.
* Fixed bug that an octopus killing itself by smashing into the ground
  would currupt the target list, crashing, or making things unshootable.
* When player is killed, now humans that he's carrying are dropped
  in a more random way.
* Fixed bug that keyboard input of high scores was not allowing enough time
  between keystrokes.
* Support .exrc file comments via " character, a la vi.
* Fixed a bug that the viewport could become unsynchronized from the player's
  y-position via contact with the ground.
* Make player's ship's exhaust behave a bit differently
  -- take y velocity into account.
* Improvements to makefile so "make install" doesn't always rebuild
  (Thanks to Seth Klein for this.)
* Fixed problem that if project made WITHAUDIO=no, compressed man page
  wasn't built (for no apparent reason.)  Thanks to Seth Klein for pointing
  this out.


Sun Jun 15 05:19:30 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.14 and 0.15

* Fixed bug that humanoids that were picked up by cron jobs no
  longer said "Help up here!" or "Help down here."
* Previous "fix" for the missing "up here!" "down here!" sounds had
  made it so that you could steal a humanoid from a cron job just by
  passing over them.  Fixed that.
* Added "--nomissilealarm" option, which suppresses the audio alarm
  you usually get when missiles lock on.
* Now, the '1' key toggles the missile alarm on/off.
* Now, the radar (if it's working) shows "MISSILE LOCK ON DETECTED" in red
  when a missile has locked on, so if the audio alarm is suppressed, there
  is still some warning.
* Changed color of gdb's missiles from magenta to red.  This is so that
  whan you shoot them, and magenta debris flies all around, the humanoids
  on the main screen, and on the radar, will be easier to see.
* Doubled the blink rate on the radar screen of the humanoids and the
  players ship.  Also, on the radar, the humans and player are represented
  by an x with a box around it.  It used to be, the x part didn't blink,
  only the box.  Now, the x and the surrounding box both blink.  This is
  to make the humans and player easier to see.
* Draw the 4 corners of the viewport on the radar screen
* Change mouse cursor to something more unobtrusive.
* Now, default options can be set via a config file: ~/.wordwarvi/.exrc
* Make .wordwarvi/.exrc file format more consitent with vi's .exrc format
* Now you can remap keyboard controls how you like via .exrc "map" command.
* Fix line counting of .exrc file, and allow shell style comments
* Fixed error in example .exrc file
* Added a couple more levels.
* Fixed bug that terrain roughness settings in level descriptors didn't
  actually take effect for any but the first level.
* Made the "attract mode" pick a random level instead of always using the
  first level.
* Now joystick controls are customizable via ~/.wordwarvi/.exrc file.
* Added a note about dealing with the lack of left/right/up/down joystick
  button customizability.
* Updated version.h

Sat Jun  7 21:48:01 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.13 and 0.14

* Fixed a horrible bug which made cron jobs unshootable.

Sat Jun  7 20:38:24 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.12 and 0.13

* Added "--retrogreen" option.  (Does exactly what it sounds like.)
* Updated usage message to include some new options which had been
  left out.
* Removed a couple debug printfs that had been accidentally left in.
* Fixed a bug that the intro screen would turn sound effects back on even
  after they had been manually switched off.
* removed unused variable sail_segment.
* Fixed usage message about "--nostarfield" option.
* Fixed a memory leak due to the old building data not being freed
  when a level begins.
* Got rid of a memory leak from the tentacle code (by simply
  making the tentacle segments a static array.)
* Added new enemy: jets.
* Fixed bug that smashing into the ground, or sides, or roof, could
  displace the player's ship relative to the edges of the screen,
  throwing the viewport off a bit.
* Improved y-axis viewport tracking.  The player is constrained
  to an area in the center of the viewport such that he can't get
  higher than 3/8ths of the way down the screen, nor lower than 5/8ths.
  When moving down, the viewport moves down faster, revealing more of
  what's below, and when moving up, the viewport moves up faster,
  revealing more of what's above.  Seems to work ok.  Also, eliminated
  gravity (used to be, if you slowed down, your ship sank down.
  This made the viewport code push the player up the screen which
  was a bit weird, so I took it out.
* Added more jets, and made them buzz closer to the player.
* Added --randomize and --randomseed options.
* Added (in debug code) a level warp option
* Added jetwash.ogg
* Added jet sound.
* Put in infrastructure for customizing the levels a bit rather than
  having them be 100% procedurally generated.  There's more levers and
  knobs to influence the procedural code now. (see levels.h).
* Fixed the bug that "Prepare to die!!!" would sometimes appear in
  the small font, rather than the big font (I think I fixed it anyway.)
* Added instructions in case people want to make their own levels.
* Fixed a bug in the tentacle placing code.
* Moved some constants out of wordwarvi.c which belonged in levels.h
* Changed the Ready/Set/Prepare to die!!! message so it tells you what
  level you're on.
* Fixed regression that ground color didn't change with each level.
* Make humanoids and player blink on the radar screen.
* Tweaking of levels
* Now, sometimes jets will crash instead of exploding when hit.


Sat May 24 03:48:04 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.11 and 0.12
* Fixed bug that we called g_threads_init() without first checking
  to see if it had already been called (it must not be called more than
  once.)  Apparently (some versions of?) portaudio call g_threads_init(),
  and on such systems, the program aborted.  Thanks to Hans de Goede for
  this fix.
* Made the --fullscreen option override the --height and --width option
  and just scale the graphics to fill the screen.  Fixed the problem that
  the window border was specified as 10 pixels, leaving a white border
  around the edges.  (There is still a thin white line at the top of the
  screen... don't know where that's coming from.)
* Deleted some unused button related stuff.
* Fixed white line at top of screen in fullscreen mode
  (Was due to box packing padding.)
* Now F11 key can be used to toggle between windowed and
  fullscreen mode.
* Now dynamic on-the-fly resize (shrink or expand freely
  in x and y dimensions) of window is allowed and re-scaling
  happens on the fly, and when in native resolution (800x600)
  the non-scaling line drawing/rectangle drawing functions
  are used.
* Added --joystick option to allow devices other than /dev/input/js0 to
  be used.

Tue May 20 06:20:09 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.10 and 0.11
* Put the pointers for linking together the target list directly in the game
  object structure, instead of having a separate target list node structure.
  This saves having to allocate/free the target list nodes.   Also forced me
  to notice, find, and fix some target list related bugs that were previously
  very hard to notice..
* Disable the kguns requiring more than 1 hit, too hard.
* Fixed the "editor now??? Where is your" bug.
* Removed debris from the target list.  This reduces the count of items
  on the target list significantly, with very little impact on the game.
  (bombs no longer shift debris around.  Big deal.)
* Added some debug code for the target list (shows target list length
  when DEBUG_TARGET_LIST is defined)
* Added highscoremusic.ogg
* Added a "high score" thingy.
* Fixed captial 'F' glyph, which was goofy looking.
* Added --fullscreen option
* Center high score in the high score screen.
* Added --nomusic option (mainly for the memory savings, as
  music could already be turned off with 'm' key.  --nomusic
  causes the .ogg files for music not to even be decoded into
  memory.)

Sun May 11 20:59:10 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.09 and 0.10

* Credit Michael Smith (xiph.org) for my hacked version of
  oggdec.c (ogg_to_pcm.c)
* Added a little easter egg worth a million bonus points.
* Changed type of variable needing to hold seconds since long ago to
  and unsigned long long, instead of an int.
* Fixed bug that if an invalid sound device was specified via --sounddevice
  option, a segfault resulted.
* Fixed problem that the ogg decoding stuff broke WITHAUDIO=no
* Remove reference to libsndfile
* Added omitted file "zzzt.ogg" to the list of files in Attribution.txt.
* Corrected minor grammar errors
* Removed mention of freesound, since no files from freesound
  are used any more.
* Mention vorbiscomment -l.
* Fixed bug that sometimes humanoids in the midst of falling
  would suddenly and instantly appear on the ground.  Problem
  was the humanoid_move function was calling find_ground_level()
  to figure out the y value of the terrain underneath the humanoid,
  and trying to see if that function failed by checking its return
  value against -1.  Problem is, -1 is a perfectly valid y value for
  terrain to have.  Should have been checking against GROUND_OOPS.
* Now the guns exhibit recoil.
* Fixed the recoil motion, which was sort of backwards.
* Added --blueprint rendering option.
* Tremendously improved keyboard support
* Improved keyboard support a bit more, I think.
* Added some debug code to debug the target list
* Added a new weapon for the player -- he gets 3 gravity bombs.
  Not sure it's a good idea, but it's in for now..
* fixed type-punned pointer warning in pcm_to_ogg call.
* Now gravity bombs fall more slowly, get more air.
* Rockets and gdbs are awakened by gravity bombs, so they
  aren't left hanging in space.
* rockets smashed into the ground by gravity bombs get destroyed.
* commented out 'n' and 'i' keys -- they are supposed to be for debugging.
* Now guns do not lead the player in y direction, only x.  This
  eliminates weird "bobbing" behavior.
* Elminated some unused code left over from the old flak guns.
* Make bullets from cron jobs a little brighter, easier to see.
* Try to make the gravity bomb look slightly cooler
* Make octo-virus heads a little bit bigger.
* Made cron jobs look a tiny bit better.
* Made humanoids ride along with their carriers in
  a bit better relative position
* When in pause mode, pause the sound too.
* When in pause mode, the radar screen displays "Time warp activated."
  like Parsec, on the ti99/4a.
* Document --blueprint option
* Fix warning about type-punned pointer (again)
* Put in infrastructure so that Now enemies can conceivably take
  more than one hit to kill.
* Cleaned up the scoring and kill tally code a bit.
* added gravity_bomb.ogg
* Added sound for gravity bomb
* Moved "attract mode" autopilot stuff into its own function
* Added insane intro "Destiny Face Down."

Sat May  3 18:46:16 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.08 and 0.09

* Removed unused code (old_kgun_draw function.)
* Fixed a longstanding bug that the vxy_2_dxy array had wrong
  values when x index == 0 (was wrong sign in y value.)
  (That is what caused the guns to be drawn, and to shoot in
  the wrong direction (down instead of up, and vice versa) if
  player->x == gun->x.  IN that case, dx == 0, and the wrong
  value for y came out of vxy_2_dxy.
* Refined gun aiming to compare dy to 20, rather than 0, as
  the gun's center is at y + 20.
* Removed dependency on libsndfile, added dependency on libvorbisfile.
  Removed dependency on oggdec (by including hunks of code from oggdec).
  (Now it decodes the ogg files itself at run time.)

Fri May  2 18:03:39 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.07 and 0.08

* Fixed very minor bug in draw_spark() function.
* When drawing stars, optimize the method by which it is
  determined whether the star is above or below the horizon.
* Make it so buildings are not so prone to being "underground" on steep
  terrain, and make them taller, on average.
* Added "kernel defense guns"
* Fix bug that portaudio can seemingly sometimes report > 0 sound devices,
  yet report the default device as -1, which caused seg fault.
* Revert accidental lowering of default frame rate.
* Fixed my previous "fix" for the sound core dump... still untested.
* Undo botched frame rate *again*.   D'oh.
* Fix bug that passing an unknown option on the command line caused a segfault.
* Bump up gcc optimization level to -O3
* Put the kernel guns dangling from trusses which can be shot apart.
* Make falling kernel guns act like bombs (explode on impact).
* Made kernel guns look really bad ass.
* The kernel guns were making the ground-based guns look bad,
  so, reused the kernel guns for the ground based guns.
* Remove debug message.

Tue Apr 29 09:05:23 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 0.06 and 0.07

* Made drawing of sparks sligtly more efficient (assuming compiler
  didn't already do those optimizations.)
* Changed how laserbolts from "flak guns" are drawn.
* Rearranged the dashboard, got rid of obtrusive stuff at top of screen.
* Now blimps shoot laser bolts at you.
* Fixed (i think) problem with text overlays caused by
  previous commit (rearranging the dashboard).
* mkdir the man page directory
* added "aaaah_it_burns.ogg"
* Humanoids are now incinerated when they get dropped into the volcano.
* As a fun experiment, put in infrastructure to allow entire game's
  display coordinates to be remapped arbitrarily (e.g. spin the
  whole display, make it disappear into space, like the words at the
  beginning of Star Wars, map it onto the side of a spinning cube...
  whatever.  Not very useful, but kind of interesting.
* Don't put things near the volcano
* Get rid of the silly mappaple draw line routine -- too
  expensive cpu-wise.
* added --brightsparks option to control how sparks are rendered.
* Make the lightning which the tentacles shoot out more glow-y.
* Make the lightning do damage to the player.
* Make the tentacles killable (by bombs, not lasers though.)
* Limit amount of thunder played.
* Increase chance and distance of lightning discharge.
* Added low priority sound function which only adds the sound if at least 5
  slots for sound are free.  This is used for the sounds which falling debris
  makes on hitting the ground.  Reasoning is, whenever there is falling
  debris, there is a lot of it, so a lot of sound slots are used up,
  sometimes all of them, which would make other sounds (explosions)
  fail to be added to the sound list.  Nobody's going to notice if a few
  falling rocks fail to make the falling rock impact sounds -- hell you
  can barely tell the video and audio are correlated -- though they are
  -- in this area.  So just give those sounds a low priority and reserve
  5 empty slots that they cannot use, so they'll be open to other things.
* Added --width and --height options to allow game to be scaled.
* Added --framerate command line option.
* Added worms.
* Made tentacles thicker.
* Now when you shoot the worms, they split in half,
  becomng two smaller worms.
* Made worms color independent of one another, and, psychedelically rainbow.
* Prevent worms from going underground
* Made worms tapered on the ends.
* Made worms harm the player, if touched.
* Made worms follow the player, if he comes close
* Made worms move a bit less erratically
* Added "zzzt!" sound effect when worms touch player
* Fixed bug that initially, there were WAY too many blimps.
  (bad initialization of the "level" structure.)
* Improved the appearance of the dumb rockets.
* Added the notion of "airship pressure."  When you shoot the blimps, they
  become hyper-pressurized, and kind of get fat with pressure and leak lisp
  code at an accelerated rate.
* When blimps explode, they throw debris, and make a sound.
* Reduced number of blimps and worms to something sensible.
* Prevent core dump if portaudio finds zero sound devices.
* Optimized finding of ground level in bridge_move function.
* Fixed a bug that debris didn't always stop moving when it was
  supposed to.
* Corrected an error in the debris bouncing algorithm.
* Fixed bug that debris became immortal.
* Calculate all the slopes of all the terrain segments ahead of time
  rather than each time we need them.
* Removed unused variables.
* Fixed up drawings of flak guns.
* Fixed a pernicious bug in the audio playback code.  (Was cycling through
  NCLIPS audio queues when there were only MAX_CONCURRENT_SOUNDS audio
  queues.)
* Added a starfield.
* Made the octo-viruses shoot lightning half-as often -- they were too hard
  (probably still are.)
* Added --nostarfield option.
* Made gdb's look a bit better
* Edited vocal sounds to make them sound like radio tranmissions.

Fri Apr 11 09:09:04 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between version 0.05 and 0.06
* Now lasers look a bit cooler
* Humanoids drop a little slower... easier to catch in midair.
* Fixed a couple of compiler warnings.
* Cleaned up the "intermission" screen between levels
* fixed bug that bonus points didn't actually apply to your score.
* Give player 1000 pt bonus for catching guys in midair.
* Make sure the humanoids don't say anything while falling
  (too busy screaming).
* Fixed a bug that add_bullet didn't set o->v to
  point to the bullet's drawing vectors.
  Sometimes (why not always????) causing a crash.
  Thanks to Hans de Goede for this patch.
* Added "install" target to makefile, and made program look in a sensible
  place for sound files if installed.  Thanks to Hans de Goede for this
  patch.
* Fixed a bug that the radar jammers could be subverted just by flying
  really high.
* Added dtox3monomix.ogg, which I'd accidentally left out.
* Allow "quarters" to be put in with the joystick buttons.
* Added "uninstall" target to Makefile
* Included man page in tarball
* "install" target installs man page now.
* Improved the way GDB's fly around.

Tue Apr  8 09:23:50 CDT 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes between version 0.04 and 0.05
* Added a new volcano eruption sound.
* Replaced all CC Sampling 1.0 licensed sound files from freesound
  with sound files of my own devising, licensed under CC Attribution-Share
  Alike 3.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 12 07:17:15 CST 2008
Changes between version 0.03 and 0.04:

* Added radar jamming stations.
* Made drawing of sparks a bit more efficient
* Fix compiler warnings, turn on optimization in make file
* Calculate frame rate
* Tighten up test to avoid drawing things off screen.
Log:
* Got rid of the floating point calculations in the random number generation
  in the "real time" areas of the code.
* Speeded up the object allocator
* Factored out code to choose initial locations of objects
* Set clipping rectangle for drawing area (I think this gets
  rid of some weird things that happen with gdk_draw_line with
  segments that go out of bounds.)
* Removed unused old debris making code which was superceded by
  the new code.
* Added a black and white mode, just for the hell of it.
* Setup to replace gdk_draw_line with whatever I want
* Changed the behavior of fuel tanks on the ground.  Now, instead of bombing
  the fuel tanks to repair damage, you hover over them, and suck out fuel,
  which powers your sheilds.  This makes a hell of a lot more sense than
  somehow getting damage repaired by bombing fuel tanks, a concept which
  I've always hated, but put in out of laziness, and trying to make the game
  work a bit better.  This change really affects the game play, because it's
  no longer a good strategy to just sort of randomly carpet bomb, as you'll
  destroy your fuel source.  Not sure if it's better or worse game play.
  Will have to live with this for awhile and see.
* Now the blimp has scrolling messages on its side.  :-D
* Made flaming debris bounce around a bit when it hits the ground.
* Now, press 'n' to go immediately to next humanoid.  (for debugging only).
* Made the player's ship interact with the ground a bit better (got rid of
  vibrating).
* Added support for joysticks.  Doesn't really work very well though.
  Not sure this game is suited to using a joystick, but it if is, my
  code needs considerable tweaking, I think.
* Try two stick joystick control... not much better, meh.
* Increase number of "cron jobs"
* Increase refueling rate to jack up the action factor a bit
  (not sitting around on fuel tanks waiting to refuel so much)
* Added a lot of comments.
* Fixed Makefile problem that wordwarvi wasn't set to depend on joystick.o
* Now ground color changes each time you advance a level.
* Added a big volcano
* Reduced the bounciness of debris... looked a little too bouncy.
* Made the rockets slightly less predictable.  They're still pretty lame.
* I think I made the joystick controls a bit better.
* Fixed bug that you could snatch a human right from a cron job
  just by running over him.
* Improved appearance of humanoids.
* Fixed bug that humans x velocity was not inherited from their
  abductor when their abductor was shot.
* Now the cron jobs pick up the humans then drop them into the
  volcano.
* Fixed bug, uninitialized variabe.  Occasionally made blimps shoot out
  too many missiles, I think.
* Ship is now damaged by volcano's corrosive atmosphere.
* Radar warns of corrosive atmosphere.
* Fixed a bug that prevented humans from being picked up by the player.
* Made humans line up under player's ship a bit more sensibly.
* Made the missiles which gdb's fire shorter, and ablt to turn faster
  and accellerate faster.
* Prevent the "Ow! My spine!" sound from playing more than once per 3 seconds.
* Put Bill Gates' state of the art warship inside a WINE bottle.
* Added --version option.
* Updated man page
* Updated copyright notices.
* Make the .swp files scream when the cron jobs drop them into the
  caldera of Mount /dev/null.
* Now, when debris hits the ground and bounces, it makes a sound.

Changelog begins after version 0.03
